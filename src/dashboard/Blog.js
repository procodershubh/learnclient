            I have enrolled in the MERN STACK internship program under the guidance of 
            Mr.SHUBHAM SIR at APPSquadz. After this, I landed a job at TCS at a very 
            handsome package for the entry-level jobs. Throughout this internship, 
            SHUBHAM SIR sir was very supportive and helped me attain this goal.
            He is the best teacher I have ever met in my life, a special thankyou to him
            and APPSquadz for providing me with this special opportunity.</p>

            This all started when I joined the 6 months internship program under the guidance of AKSHAY SIR. 
            He is simply a genius teacher providing valuable information to all aspiring students. 
            That was a great decision for me to enroll in the special 6-months internship program of APPSquadz. 
            This IT training institute is truly a temple to learn JAVA and become proficient.
             The learnings I got here will help me to grow my career.</p>
